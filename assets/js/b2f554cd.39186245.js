The observer.\\n\\nThat observer is verily you and everything around you. In and out of you. That is all there really is.\\n\\nAnd you, I, us, this collective consciousness, of the ultimate consciousness of it all, the one being, simply flows through cycles of dualities. Of stark contrasts, emerging into infinite fractals of stories.\\n\\nWhether the above sentence made sense to you or not, I want you to focus on \'you\' reading this, making sense of this sentence, attaching it to the memory recording of \'language\' in the brain, essentially running the algorithm of \'parsing English\'. All of that is automatically happening and you, simply *you*, are observing it. Not the details of the process of language parsing but the **essence** of these sentences. The fact, the essence, the truth underlying in these sentences, to make sense of them. \\"Cats\' pink turfy picks\\" doesn\'t make sense to you, but \\"Cats lick puffy sticks.\\" does. The latter has a coherent sense of \'truth\' to it. You can imagine cats licking an object, since you observed it before. You know it to be true, a scenario that can happen in real life, based on memory of it happening in the past. However, the former doesn\'t make sense to you because you had not observed something like that happening, so it was never recorded in memory, so you aren\'t even sure if that phrase is grammatically correct. \'Correct\', as in true.\\n\\nThis is the extent to which, us beings, us as conscious observers, rely on truth to make sense of anything. Things only make sense due to truth, or the absence of it, which again is defined based on absence of the presence of truth. Simply put, truth makes anything make sense. This truth is shaped by history, through memory.\\n\\nBut what happens when this history gets distorted? What if it deviates from the truth? What if past experiences aren\'t recorded correctly, and there is random falsity added, as noise?\\n\\nWell, the idea of anything making sense can be thrown out of the window, of course.\\n\\nThat is exactly what is happening in the modern society as we experience it. We might as well be reading a story in a language we do not understand, but simply because you believe everyone else is reading the same book and are seemingly understanding it, you do too. This is so common that there is a term for this, called \'Pluralistic ignorance\'.\\n\\n> Pluralistic ignorance refers to a situation in which virtually every member of a group privately disagrees with what are considered to be the prevailing attitudes and beliefs of the group as a whole.\\n\\n> Pluralistic ignorance is a phenomenon that occurs when people mistakenly believe that everyone else holds a different opinion from their own.\\nThis often leads to a false consensus, where people conform to the thought-to-be majority opinion, even though it may not be considered just by the majority of people.\\n\\n> Pluralistic ignorance can have dangerous consequences, as it can lead to people remaining silent in the face of injustice or engaging in risky behaviors. These can manifest in environments ranging from the classroom to entire political systems. [^1]\\n\\n[^1]: https://www.simplypsychology.org/pluralistic-ignorance.html\\n\\nEveryone simply is playing a role in magnifying a collective illusion, where there is only an illusion of \'truth\', an illusion that things make sense the way they are. However, we have already far deviated from making sense millennia ago. What we speak, do and think is actually gibberish, as long as it is based on falsity, on noise, on deviations from truth, on distortions in the consistent stream of knowledge of occurrences recorded exactly the way they happened. Similar to DNA transcription, the mutations (deviations) that have occurred have proven to be non-sustainable just due to the sheer number of them occurring like cancer. So now, history is just a sore victim of cancerous distortion in the modern era.\\n\\nThe source of this deviation is time itself: a sequence of events of transfer of observed information, one after another, as a series. Just like a game of [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers).  \\n\\nWe all can intuitively understand this. It is almost common sense, everyday experience, everyday observation, of meaning getting lost in translation. Nothing new.\\n\\nYet somehow, we still collectively live this life of lies, because we believe it isn\'t a life of lies. Why?\\n\\nI think it is because we have not once tried to pause, and question it all. We have not once tried to stop feeding ourselves with lies, because we do not even know how to distinguishing truth from falsity anymore. Literally, in this modern era, people eat [plastic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/27/fast-food-phthalates-plastics/), [lead](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/lead-food-foodwares-and-dietary-supplements#:~:text=Lead%2C%20if%20present%20in%20food,as%20a%20food%20contact%20substance) and [glass](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/20/starbucks-vanilla-frappuccino-drinks-recalled-glass).\\n\\nBut it is time to pause. Take a vow of fasting, even if briefly, to stop feeding our bodies, mind and intellect the unnatural, the falsity, the lies spun up by the ego. It is instead time we question literally everything with an open mind. Our own existence, own our experience as human, here on Earth. We believe science has it all figured out. We evolved from primates, from stone tools to a cool technologically advanced society? Hah! That is **far** from the truth. Not even close to it. We, as modern humans, I repeat again, have no idea about [our true origins](https://motadaka.medium.com/ancient-civilizations-and-earths-history-4f704878a309). We, in fact, [have no clue about how language came about to be](https://study.com/learn/lesson/evolution-language-origins-theories.html), we literally do not even know [what gravity really is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsUm9mNXrX4), nor do we know [how consciousness works](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness), as conscious beings! Yet simply because we have observed them all, we falsely believe that observing is knowing. Knowing is observing but not the other way around. You can observe a constellation in the sky and not know what it is. But if you know of a constellation in the sky, you by default observe it (think about it) first in mind\'s eye by the virtue of knowing it, and you can easily observe it in the night sky too, simply by knowing of the constellation.\\n\\nThe point is, what we believe in is misplaced. What we observe and how we believe it to be observed is misplaced. We believe in falsity. Not truth, anymore. This can truly only be fixed by first realizing how little we know about our own existence, about anything really, and how based on such little truth, we pretend as if we know it all, and are destroying the Earth, our own selves as humanity.\\n\\nIt is time we take a pause and contemplate it all, on what it means to exist. On what \'truth\' really is. The first and the easiest step towards this journey of truth, of self discovery in fact, is simply [meditation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNYw4m2zJQU).\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\"frame\\">\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSuCAOGh5FY\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nTaking a pause, breathing, and asking your deepest inner self, free from your daily identities, really asking the silence in you to show you the truth. To help you reach the truth.\\n\\nRadical change can only happen on Earth, in our collective consciousness, when each and every individual consciousness (in the form of humans) genuinely silences everything, all this false noise, and questions with a completely open mind and open heart: \\"what **is** the truth?\\", with the utmost belief that the answer will be revealed for the betterment of humankind.\\n\\n\\n> \u0950... from the unreal, lead us to real\\n\\n>>From ignorance, lead us to true knowledge\\n\\n>>>From limited, lead us to unlimited\\n\\n>>>>Peace, peace, peace!\\n\\n\\n</details>"},{"id":"blizzard","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/blizzard","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2022-12-29-blizzard/rights.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-29-blizzard/rights.md","title":"surviving the Buffalo Blizzard of 2022","description":"The Blizzard of 2022.","date":"2022-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 29, 2022","tags":[{"label":"podcast","permalink":"/blog/tags/podcast"},{"label":"climate","permalink":"/blog/tags/climate"},{"label":"society","permalink":"/blog/tags/society"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.125,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"the power of belief","permalink":"/blog/belief"},"nextItem":{"title":"giants and hindu civilization","permalink":"/blog/giants"}},"content":"<details>\\n\\n<summary> The Blizzard of 2022.    \\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n<div class=\\"frame\\">\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNYw4m2zJQU\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</details>"},{"id":"giants","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/giants","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2022-07-03-giants/rights.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-03-giants/rights.md","title":"giants and hindu civilization","description":"history","date":"2022-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"podcast","permalink":"/blog/tags/podcast"},{"label":"history","permalink":"/blog/tags/history"},{"label":"science","permalink":"/blog/tags/science"},{"label":"archaeology","permalink":"/blog/tags/archaeology"}],"readingTime":4.905,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"surviving the Buffalo Blizzard of 2022","permalink":"/blog/blizzard"},"nextItem":{"title":"wade vs. roe overruling flaws","permalink":"/blog/WadevRoe"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <title>history</title>\\n  <script src=\\"https://unpkg.com/@ungap/custom-elements-builtin\\"><\/script>\\n  <script src=\\"x-frame-bypass.js\\" type=\\"module\\"><\/script>\\n</head>\\n\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary> Giants existed on Earth.    \\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://share.descript.com/embed/xj4wy2TVU5n\\" width=\\"50%\\" height=\\"410\\" frameborder=\\"0\\"></iframe>\\n\\n\\n\\n# **We really have no idea of our human origins!!**\\n\\nThe universe is so beautiful.\\nIt is just a never ending series of mesmerizing fractal pattern flowing away into infinity.\\nAnd so is the story of our earth, the universe it is in. So far with our advancement in science with the field of [cosmochemistry we can use radio isotope dating](http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Nov03/Hf-W.html) to help the field of earth sciences. So according to the current science on life on Earth was found fairly quickly after Earth\'s formation 4.2 billion years ago.

Rendering pages, accessibly.\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n   If anything, a website can be boiled down to \\"rendering pages with information\\". So, you gotta have that in place! To take it up a notch, however, an important ability is to render pages on different screens and formats (from accessible dictation enabled to translatable in multiple languages).\\n\\n![kao1](./009.gif)\\n\\n   As long as your pages are easily accessible to your target audience, your website is in a great position already!\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n\\n### 2. Setting in place an editable workflow\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n   Unless the point of your website is a one time done deal where it is meant to be completely static, it might be useful to set up a predefined, well-staged workflow that you can recreate over and over again in order to make changes to your site efficiently!\\n\\n\\n   ![kao4](./lunetta04.gif)\\n\\n   I personally use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) Docusaurus to do the heavy-weight lifting of getting all of my posts sorted and displayed correctly (and prettily). The most I do is make a new blog post in the blog directory using Atom (and IDE) . Then I simply the run the commands to publish:\\n\\n  ```python\\n  yarn build\\n  yarn deploy\\n  ```\\n\\n  The initial set up might be tedious but it does pay off in the long run!\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n\\n### 3. Integrating with version control\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n\\n   ![kao6](./kao1.gif)\\n\\n  Last time I wanted to make changes to my website, I had messed up the package.json file and couldn\'t get yarn to execute its handy scripts for the life of me.\\n\\n\\n  It then led me to a rabbit-hole of frustration and deletions where I ended up losing my entire project locally (I wish I knew how I messed up **that** bad!!). But, mishaps happen! The only saving light happened to be a random branch I had accidentally made on GitHub when I still had all the files in tact.\\n\\n\\n   ![kao8](./ugh.gif)\\n\\n  Now, with that experience, I am a huge propagator of keeping track of almost all changes you make to your site using git (or your favorite version control system). Trust me, it is going to be a literal sanity saver.\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>   \\n<summary>\\n\\n### 4. Using as few frameworks as possible\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n   ![kao9](./014.gif)\\n\\n  I basically run this entire website using Docusaurus which helps me manage [React, Markdown](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/). Docusaurus also has its own CSS styling tool called [Infima](https://infima.dev/) that standardizes all the themes on here, making things look simple and consistent! Of course, React makes my site very scalable (to the point that you can size down your browser to extremes and still not have most components act up and look horrible).\\n\\n\\n  In summary, pick a great framework that has all the needs of your website handled, all in one place, while also giving you the ability to completely take control over every component if needed.\\n\\n\\n   ![kao11](./020.gif)\\n\\n  I have made a significant amount of additions and changes to the basic [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/playground) features by learning the specifics of the technologies it builds on!\\n\\n\\n  You will know you have picked a great framework if it lets you break it apart and take control over all the tools it uses, while also exposing you to these new tools, helping you learn!\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n\\n### 5. Hosting the site\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n  It\'s not as fun if your website stays forever in localhost, never branching out into the world wide web! Again, an overwhelming number of site hosting solutions ranging from GoDaddy, WordPress and even some GUI based website builders such as Wix and Squaresite are out there for use.\\n\\n  I am assuming, since you are reading this, you are tech savvy enough to not settle for pure GUI drag and drop website builders though (which is the best way to go in my personal opinion).  \\n\\n  ![kao13](./computer05.gif)\\n\\n\\n  Just by learning a little bit of the basics of web hosting (and cloud services), you can host a pretty heavy-weight website for FREE on the interwebs. My webpage, as the name suggests, uses GitHub. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) is very highly documented and has an active community (similar to Docusaurus). It makes it super simple for me to push changes for the world to see with a few simple command line inputs locally.\\n\\n\\n  Again, the initial research and getting used to will be very tedious, but once you do find the right hosting service, you will know you found THE ONE when it boils down to being super simple in the long run. Plus, I get a cool domain name without spending a single cent!\\n\\n  I have seen other commercial hosting services purposefully give their users really ugly, long and gross default domain names to incentivize them to spend money for better ones.\\n\\n  ![kao12](./018.gif)\\n\\n  That would not be the case if you were to choose a cloud hosting service such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/solutions/website-hosting/), [GitHub pages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/hosting-your-website-on-github), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting) etc. (which do require you to know coding).\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n\\n### 6. Making the site visually appealing\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n  Some go-to\'s to have on your site:\\n\\n  - Scalable graphics\\n  - Collapsible sections\\n  - Minimal text blobs\\n  - Spacious layout\\n\\n  ![kao007](./tiny.gif)\\n\\n  This area is more subjective than not and does depend on your preferences. However, if you want to tune your site towards a general range of audience, the simpler and easier to use your website is, the better!\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n\\n### 7. Browser console debugging\\n\\n</summary>\\n\\n  In browser console\'s have really upped their game. Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, [Brave](https://brave.com/) have an almost IDE like console!\\n\\n  > \u2728 Brave: I recently found out about. It is super cool and gives creators cryptocurrency. I will make another post all about crypto, next!\\n\\n\\n  For now, I wanted to mention about the tool named: \\"Lighthouse\\". This is a website auditing tool which conveniently fetches you a report on your site\'s performance and compliance with web and security standards.\\n\\n  If anything, I would highly suggest any web dev out there to run their sites through Lighthouse at least once before deployment and take a note of the report!\\n\\n  ![kao003](./barre14.gif)\\n\\n  Here\'s a quick look at a report that was generated for this site (~~no bragging intended~~):\\n\\n  ![lighthouse](./lighthouse.png)\\n\\n  If you expand the report, Lighthouse lays out all the details on what could be improved on your page, along with links to resources on building accessible, fast and reliable webpages! It is a great tool to truly delve deep into the world of web development.\\n\\n  ![kao005](./fuu.gif)\\n\\n</details>\\n\\nI will leave it at these brief 7 ideas. Implementing them have personally helped me a lot in learning web development. Hopefully, these basic approaches can help you make a great website! And, good luck on centering that div!\\n\\n![kao002](./barre18.gif)\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n</details>\\n</article>"},{"id":"Breakthrough Junior Challenge Videos","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Breakthrough Junior Challenge Videos","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2021-11-13-archive/archive.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-13-archive/archive.md","title":"archive of science videos","description":"Breakthrough Junior Challenge Videos!","date":"2021-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 13, 2021","tags":[{"label":"videos","permalink":"/blog/tags/videos"},{"label":"animation","permalink":"/blog/tags/animation"},{"label":"science","permalink":"/blog/tags/science"}],"readingTime":0.53,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"tips for making your website great!","permalink":"/blog/Building Simple WebApps"},"nextItem":{"title":"automating the web!","permalink":"/blog/auto"}},"content":"<details>\\n<summary> Breakthrough Junior Challenge Videos! </summary>\\n\\n### Here is the saga of the videos\\n> that did not get to see the light of day after the challenges ended ~~and because I was too shy to make them **public** public~~\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary> On Nuclear Power, 2018 </summary>\\n\\n<div class=\\"frame\\">\\n<iframe id=\\"ytplayer\\" type=\\"text/html\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400\\"\\nsrc=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/scwKfxHTfPI?cc_load_policy=1&enablejsapi=1&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&color=white\\"\\nframeborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary> On Fire, 2017 </summary>\\n\\n<div class=\\"frame\\">\\n<iframe id=\\"ytplayer\\" type=\\"text/html\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400\\"\\nsrc=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Zus1DGcvoM?cc_load_policy=1&enablejsapi=1&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&color=white\\"\\nframeborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary> On Meditation, 2016 </summary>\\n\\n<div class=\\"frame\\">\\n<iframe id=\\"ytplayer\\" type=\\"text/html\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400\\"\\nsrc=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pAGmtlv2mCA?cc_load_policy=1&enablejsapi=1&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&color=white\\"\\nframeborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n#### too late to unsee them anymore\\n\\n</details>"},{"id":"auto","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/auto","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2021-11-12-auto/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-12-auto/index.md","title":"automating the web!","description":"So you have to register for classes at 7:00am...","date":"2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 12, 2021","tags":[{"label":"python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python"},{"label":"web scraping","permalink":"/blog/tags/web-scraping"}],"readingTime":2.19,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"archive of science videos","permalink":"/blog/Breakthrough Junior Challenge Videos"},"nextItem":{"title":"so, I met...","permalink":"/blog/sean carroll!"}},"content":"<details>\\n<summary> So you have to register for classes at 7:00am... </summary>\\n\\n## Let python do it for you with Selenium\\n\\n[![click me](./logo.svg)](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)\\n\\nSelenium is a web scraping tool that beautifully integrates with python. It allows you to automate webpage interactions.\\n\\nI stumbled across it a while ago, but I had not used the actual API until recently. Long story short, I had to make a doctor\'s appointment right at 12am to even find a spot (thank you American healthcare system!).\\n\\nRegardless, whether it be to automate time sensitive actions or long and arduous form filling, Selenium is here for your rescue. I will go over a few useful Selenium methods that should equip you with basic webpage interactions.\\n\\n> Note: these methods work as of November 2021\\n\\n### Useful Selenium methods\\n\\n---\\n\\n`service.start()`\\n\\nThis [method](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Service.html) allows to set up a browser driver.\\n\\nI personally used the chrome driver:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom selenium import webdriver\\n\\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service\\n\\nservice = Service(\'/path/to/chromedriver\')\\n\\nservice.start()\\n```\\n\\n> You will have to locally install the \'chromedriver\' executable. You can install it and find more usage examples [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started).\\n\\n---\\n`driver.get(url)`\\n\\nOnce you have the browser all set up, you can connect to it remotely with Selenium using the .get method as follows:\\n\\n```python\\ndriver = webdriver.Remote(service.service_url)\\ndriver.get(\'[insert url of page you want to selenium to work its magic on]\')\\n```\\n\\nAnd, that\'s the basic set up! You can now inspect element on the target webpage to figure out which fields you want to automate interaction with.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`driver.find_element`\\n\\nLet\'s say, I want to automatically search something on Google. I would first figure out the class name/ID of the search bar using \\"inspect element\\":\\n\\n![google](./snip.png)\\n\\nSince there is only a class name of `gLFyf` attached, it would be used to select the search bar and insert a value to search using the code:\\n\\n```python\\nsearchbar = \'gLFyf\'\\ndriver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,searchbar).send_keys(\\"[value to search]\\")\\n```\\n\\n> The send_keys method can take an array as well to fit the format of the input field. Regardless of the type of input, \\" \\" are needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n`actions`\\n\\nFinally, you can make Selenium click the search button by repeating a similar process of finding the search button\'s class name/ID. Here\'s a sample snippet:\\n\\n```python\\nsubmit = \\"gNO89b\\"\\ndriver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, submit).click()\\n```\\n\\n> A full list of different actions Selenium can perform can be found [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/navigating.html).\\n\\n---\\n\\n`driver.quit()`\\n\\nDon\'t forget to close the automation process and the browser by using the quit method at the end!\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Have fun with your newfound web super power.\\n\\n> Tip: you can also schedule your python script to execute during specific times using [cron](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/cron#Crontab_format)\\n\\n</details>"},{"id":"sean carroll!","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/sean carroll!","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2021-10-01-yay/omg.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-01-yay/omg.md","title":"so, I met...","description":"Sean Carroll","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"noteworthy","permalink":"/blog/tags/noteworthy"}],"readingTime":0.32,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"automating the web!","permalink":"/blog/auto"},"nextItem":{"title":"experimental podcast audio","permalink":"/blog/voicenote"}},"content":"<details>\\n<summary> Sean Carroll </summary>\\n\\n![sean](./sean.gif)\\n\\n## on: [*The Many World of Quantum Physics*](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/)\\n> Physicist [Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/), from CalTech, gave a guest lecture [here at my university!!](https://www.facebook.com/ubphysics/photos/pcb.6325105130896296/6325099690896840)\\n> ***\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary> I asked him.... </summary>\\n\\n![snigdha](./snig.png)\\n\\n> many questions but my favorite pick is: *\\"why the universe is thought to be symmetric?\\"* and he said..\\n\\n>>\\n       \\"it doesn\'t have to be!\\"\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n</details>"},{"id":"voicenote","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/voicenote","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2021-09-10-voicenote/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-10-voicenote/index.md","title":"experimental podcast audio","description":"atypicalhuman0.0","date":"2021-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 10, 2021","tags":[{"label":"voice note","permalink":"/blog/tags/voice-note"}],"readingTime":0.11,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"so, I met...","permalink":"/blog/sean carroll!"},"nextItem":{"title":"archive of garage music","permalink":"/blog/Videos of Audios"}},"content":"<details>\\n<summary> atypicalhuman0.0 </summary>\\n\\n[![badge](./podcastBadge.svg)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3n8tSckrE9JK0GEfWHWsmm?si=YI-KNx71QYSzBPs8sBrOFw)\\n\\n## experimental note:\\n![experiment](./experiment.gif)\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>    audio:    </summary>\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://share.descript.com/embed/6nlw0DbxEUg\\" width=\\"auto\\" height=\\"900\\" display=\\"block\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\n</details>\\n</details>"},{"id":"Videos of Audios","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Videos of Audios","editUrl":"https://github.com/snigui/snigui.github.io/blog/2016-07-18-music/music.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-07-18-music/music.md","title":"archive of garage music","description":"Musical exploration, from the teenage era","date":"2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 18, 2016","tags":[{"label":"videos","permalink":"/blog/tags/videos"},{"label":"animation","permalink":"/blog/tags/animation"},{"label":"music","permalink":"/blog/tags/music"},{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":0.39,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"snigdha","title":"bit flipper","url":"https://github.com/snigui","imageURL":"/img/icn.jpg","key":"snigdha"}],"prevItem":{"title":"experimental podcast audio","permalink":"/blog/voicenote"}},"content":"<details>\\n<summary> Musical exploration, from the teenage era </summary>\\n\\n### Nothing much to listen here\\n> just some music I made using Garageband back in the day ~~that have been well hidden from the world because I was too embarrassed by my horrible skills at making music~~\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary> Garageband Musicals </summary>\\n\\n<div class=\\"frame\\">\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLzoRCirCtkr98lCaTViuyHj9ISGuKvhWT\\" title=\\"music\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### too late to unhear them anymore\\n\\n</details>"}]}')}}]);
