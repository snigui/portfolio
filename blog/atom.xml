        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<details><summary> The power of belief in Truth</summary><p><img src="./firebird.gif" alt="firebird"/></p><blockquote><p>ॐ असतो मा सद्गमय ।</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>मृत्योर्मा अमृतं गमय ।</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><h2>Reality</h2><p>Reality runs on a <code>while true</code> loop, spiraling into a divine work of art.</p><p>Abiding in this truth unlocks the potential to an infinity of possibilities.</p><p>All philosophy, science and religion (spirituality) converges to that one fact alone.</p><blockquote><p>Om Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya |</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Tamaso Maa Jyotir-Gamaya |</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya |</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>&#x27;I think, therefore I am&#x27; to &#x27;Collapse of the wavefunction in Hilbert space, upon measurement&#x27; to &#x27;I am that formless causal cause of it all, so let there be...&#x27;</p><p>All of them point to the inevitable truth of perception, of conscious thinking, of conscious measurement, of conscious creation of &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;me&#x27;, &#x27;you&#x27;. The observer.</p><p>That observer is verily you and everything around you. In and out of you. That is all there really is.</p><p>And you, I, us, this collective consciousness, of the ultimate consciousness of it all, the one being, simply flows through cycles of dualities. Of stark contrasts, emerging into infinite fractals of stories.</p><p>Whether the above sentence made sense to you or not, I want you to focus on &#x27;you&#x27; reading this, making sense of this sentence, attaching it to the memory recording of &#x27;language&#x27; in the brain, essentially running the algorithm of &#x27;parsing English&#x27;. All of that is automatically happening and you, simply you, are observing it. Not the details of the process of language parsing but the essence of these sentences. The fact, the truth, underlying in these sentences, to make sense of them. &quot;Cats&#x27; pink turfy picks&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense to you, but &quot;Cats lick puffy sticks.&quot; does. The latter has a coherent sense of &#x27;truth&#x27; to it. You can imagine cats licking an object, since you observed it before. You know it to be true, a scenario that can happen in real life, based on memory of it happening in the past. However, the former sentence doesn&#x27;t make sense to you because you had not observed something like that happening and aren&#x27;t even sure if that sentence is grammatically correct. &#x27;Correct&#x27;, as in true.</p><p>This is the extent to which, us beings, us as conscious observers rely on truth to make sense of anything. Things only make sense due to truth, or the absence of it, which again is defined based on absence of the presence of truth. Simply put, truth makes anything make sense. This truth is shaped by history, through memory.</p><p>But what happens when this history gets distorted? What if it deviates from the truth? What if past experiences aren&#x27;t recorded correctly, and there is random falsity added, as noise?</p><p>That is exactly what is happening in the modern society as we experience it. We might as well be reading a story in a language we do not understand, but simply because you believe everyone else is reading the same book and are seemingly understanding it, you do too. This is so common that there is a term for this, called &#x27;Pluralistic ignorance&#x27;.</p><blockquote><p>Pluralistic ignorance refers to a situation in which virtually every member of a group privately disagrees with what are considered to be the prevailing attitudes and beliefs of the group as a whole.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pluralistic ignorance is a phenomenon that occurs when people mistakenly believe that everyone else holds a different opinion from their own.
This often leads to a false consensus, where people conform to the thought-to-be majority opinion, even though it may not be considered just by the majority of people.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pluralistic ignorance can have dangerous consequences, as it can lead to people remaining silent in the face of injustice or engaging in risky behaviors. These can manifest in environments ranging from the classroom to entire political systems. <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Everyone simply is playing a role in magnifying a collective illusion, that has already far deviated from the truth millennia ago. The source of this deviation is time itself: a sequence of events of transfer of observed information, one after another, as a series. Just like a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">telephone</a>.  </p><p>We all know this already. It is almost common sense, everyday experience, everyday observation, of meaning getting lost in translation. Nothing new.</p><p>Yet somehow, we still collectively live this life of lies, because we believe it isn&#x27;t a life of lies. Why?</p><p>I think it is because we have not once tried to pause, and question it. Question literally everything. Our own existence, own our experience as human, here on Earth. We believe science has it all figured out. We evolved from primates, from stone tools to a cool technologically advanced society? Hah! That is <strong>far</strong> from the truth. Not even close to it. We, as modern humans, I repeat again, have no idea about <a href="https://motadaka.medium.com/ancient-civilizations-and-earths-history-4f704878a309">our true origins</a>. We, in fact, <a href="https://study.com/learn/lesson/evolution-language-origins-theories.html">have no clue about how language came about to be</a>, we literally do not even know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsUm9mNXrX4">what gravity really is</a>, nor do we know <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">how consciousness works</a>, as conscious beings! Yet simply because we have observed them all, we falsely believe that observing is knowing. Knowing is observing but not the other way around. You can observe a constellation in the sky and not know what it is. But if you know of a constellation in the sky, you by default observe it (think about it) first in mind&#x27;s eye by the virtue of knowing it, and you can easily observe it in the night sky too, simply by knowing of the constellation.</p><p>The point is, what we believe in is misplaced. What we observe and how we believe it to be observed is misplaced. We believe in falsity. Not truth, anymore. This can truly only be fixed by first realizing how little we know about our own existence, about anything really, and how based on such little truth, we pretend as if we know it all, and are destroying the Earth, our own selves as humanity.</p><p>It is time we take a pause and contemplate it all, on what it means to exist. On what &#x27;truth&#x27; really is. The first and the easiest step towards this journey of truth, of self discovery in fact, is simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNYw4m2zJQU">meditation</a>.</p><div class="frame"><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNYw4m2zJQU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><p>Taking a pause, breathing, and asking your deepest inner self, free from your daily identities, really asking the silence in you to show you the truth. To help you reach the truth.</p><p>Radical change can only happen on Earth, in our collective consciousness, when each and every individual consciousness (in the form of humans) genuinely silences everything, all this false noise, and questions with a completely open mind and open heart: &quot;what <strong>is</strong> the truth?&quot;, with the utmost belief that the answer will be revealed for the betterment of humankind.</p><blockquote><p>ॐ... from the unreal, lead us to real</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>From ignorance, lead us to true knowledge</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>From limited, lead us to unlimited</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Peace, peace, peace!</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></details><div class="footnotes"><hr/><ol><li id="fn-1"><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/pluralistic-ignorance.html">https://www.simplypsychology.org/pluralistic-ignorance.html</a><a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li></ol></div>]]></content>

It is just a never ending series of mesmerizing fractal pattern flowing away into infinity.
And so is the story of our earth, the universe it is in. So far with our advancement in science with the field of <a href="http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Nov03/Hf-W.html">cosmochemistry we can use radio isotope dating</a> to help the field of earth sciences. So according to the current science on life on Earth was found fairly quickly after Earth&#x27;s formation 4.2 billion years ago. Researchers from University of Washington, there were fossils that date back to as old as 3.5 BILLION years. That&#x27;s 3,500,000,000 year&#x27;s ago from this era.</p><p><a href="https://atmos.uw.edu/academics/classes/2001Q1/211/Group_projects/group_X_W01/tanya.htm">https://atmos.uw.edu/academics/classes/2001Q1/211/Group_projects/group_X_W01/tanya.htm</a></p><p>Keeping that in mind, and the new discovery old gigantic fossils:</p><p><a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/news/found-surviving-evidence-earth%E2%80%99s-formative-years">https://carnegiescience.edu/news/found-surviving-evidence-earth%E2%80%99s-formative-years</a></p><p><img src="./shot1.png" alt="shot1"/></p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/4000yearold-longshan-giant-discovered-in-shaanxi-province-china/7D8BCF4229362A6BD6E9457CA81AD820">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/4000yearold-longshan-giant-discovered-in-shaanxi-province-china/7D8BCF4229362A6BD6E9457CA81AD820</a></p><p>It&#x27;s no wonder anything might have happened between those long periods of time here on Earth that we might have no idea about!</p><p>So the existence of Giants with a far advanced ancient technology, and perhaps, multiple other simulations of creation, evolution and destruction of far more civilizations, might have happened before us current human inhabitants of the Earth.</p><p>And perhaps it&#x27;s through &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;myth&quot; that this record-keeping of Earth&#x27;s past was even done. A prime example for this is the Hindu civilization&#x27;s &quot;Hinduism&quot;. A lot of recent scientific evidence for ideas from Hindu&#x27;s ancient scriptures has been coming forth recently.</p><p>With the existence of multiverses being the biggest revelation in Physics!</p><div class="frame"><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aUW7patpm9s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><p>So looking at religion, there&#x27;s a recurring theme of &quot;giant gods&quot; throughout folklore from different cultures around the world:</p><blockquote><div class="frame"><iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_giants_in_mythology_and_folklore#Indian_religions" width="100%" height="360"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><img src="./shot0.png" alt="shot0"/></p><p>Source: American Museum of Natural History, <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/mythic-creatures/land/greek-giants">https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/mythic-creatures/land/greek-giants</a>

This leads to a great scientific case for ancient Hindu puranas to be true. The stories in them  might actually have been true and happened right here on Earth in the past!</p><blockquote><div class="frame"><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-KNx9pXun7I" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_of_Castelnau">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_of_Castelnau</a></p></blockquote><p>The literal mountain, Kailasa, was an archeological feat.</p><p>Not only that, in Hindu &quot;mythology&quot; (the term now apparently used for ancient historical records), Ramayana, the kind Ravana had advanced technology which has concrete evidence in the current world in the form of &quot;Sigiriya&quot;:</p><div class="frame"><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhDy7ygZg50" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><p>Sigiriya is just the surface of what ancient Hindu cultures were able to build.</p><p>From Ajanta and Ellora caves to the Angkor Wat temple, these incredible structures cannot be build with current human technology!</p><p>Ajanta and Ellora caves were carved into literal mountains, as if 3D modelling renders materialized into rock.</p><div class="frame"><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WypT8RPUxg" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><p>Curiously, there are many conflicts with the whole &quot;out of Africa theory&quot; for the origins of modern human. Truth be told, new evidence is pointing towards ancient human DNA originating from <strong>South East Asia</strong>, where India is located, which was the site of major Hindu cultures and advanced science and art.</p><p><img src="./shot2.png" alt="shot2"/></p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/modern-humans-were-southeast-asia-20000-years-earlier-thought-ancient-teeth-reveal">https://www.science.org/content/article/modern-humans-were-southeast-asia-20000-years-earlier-thought-ancient-teeth-reveal</a></p><p>This area was also where the hobbit was as discovered. And, yes. Hobbits existed too. They are called &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;.</p><p><img src="./shot3.png" alt="shot4"/></p><p>Shows how much there is to uncover about our own mysterious origins!</p><p>All of this was evidence builds towards how the Hindu &quot;mythologies&quot; of Ramayana and Mahabharata being real life events. Complete with the incredible feats of god like achievements beyond current technological capabilities. What&#x27;s more, these stories date all the way back to at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Ramayana#Dating">7000 years ago</a> in the past, with <a href="https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/9009/did-ramayana-occur-1-6-million-years-ago">much debate</a> going on dating it as far as a million years ago (yikes, a big margin but old nonetheless)!</p><p>One more example for this from the Hindu mythology is the &quot;Rama Setu&quot;, built by Rama and Vanara&#x27;s army to cross over to Lanka to rescue Sita, Rama&#x27;s abducted wife by king Ravana:</p><div class="frame"><iframe height="315" width="80%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oF8g0RpabEQ" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><p>So...what am I trying to say? Basically we know nothing about human origins, our ancient ancestor&#x27;s scientific and spiritual advancement. Many sacred Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita (ancient philosophy), Surya Siddhanta (ancient book on cosmology), Susruta Samhita (ancient book on surgery), Avurveda (ancient plant medicine) and more have profound scientific, philosophical and spiritual findings that are carelessly dismissed as &quot;mythology&quot; in the modern era. Hinduism was a culture of advanced science and art, before it ever was a religion. And, surprisingly, giants were once part of it!</p><p>Bhagavad Gita:</p><div class="frame"><iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita" width="100%" height="360" frameBorder="0"></iframe></div><p>Surya Siddhanta:</p><div class="frame"><iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Siddhanta" width="100%" height="360" frameBorder="0"></iframe></div><p>Susruta Samhita:</p><div class="frame"><iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita" width="100%" height="360" frameBorder="0"></iframe></div><p>Ramayana:</p><div class="frame"><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKcOjnDJfzk" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><p>P.S:</p><p>Not to mention the <a href="https://www.talkpundit.com/lord-hanumans-giant-footprints-throughout-asia/">giant footprints found throughout the world</a>.</p><blockquote><div class="frame"><iframe src="http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_58_1949/Volume_58%2C_No._4/The_footprints_of_Tarawa%2C_by_I._G._Turbott%2C_p_193-197/p1" width="50%" height="250" frameBorder="0"></iframe></div></blockquote><p>Apparently Smithsonian had a say in a <a href="https://medium.com/understanding-reality/7-examples-of-proof-that-giants-existed-7e2de8806a0f">giant cover up</a>. No conclusive proof though.</p><p>All of this leads to a fascinating wild conclusion that we actually have no real idea of our true origin as humans. The <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-latest-fossil-finds-make-the-puzzle-of-human-evolution-harder-than-ever-to-solve/">origins of humans is quiteeee... complicated</a> and shrouded in mystery. Maybe it is time to turn to Hindu scriptures for answers. Who knows! We, in fact, might just be living through a simulation of evolution, and destruction in our infinite parallel, multiversal universe.</p></details><p><a href="/comments">Comments</a></p><div class="frame"><iframe is="x-frame-bypass" src="/comments" width="50%" height="250"></iframe></div>]]></content>

Setting in place an editable workflow</h3></summary><p>   Unless the point of your website is a one time done deal where it is meant to be completely static, it might be useful to set up a predefined, well-staged workflow that you can recreate over and over again in order to make changes to your site efficiently!</p><p>   <img src="./lunetta04.gif" alt="kao4"/></p><p>   I personally use <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs">Docusaurus</a> Docusaurus to do the heavy-weight lifting of getting all of my posts sorted and displayed correctly (and prettily). The most I do is make a new blog post in the blog directory using Atom (and IDE) . Then I simply the run the commands to publish:</p><pre><code class="language-python">yarn build
yarn deploy
</code></pre><p>  The initial set up might be tedious but it does pay off in the long run!</p></details><details><summary><h3>3. Integrating with version control</h3></summary><p>   <img src="./kao1.gif" alt="kao6"/></p><p>  Last time I wanted to make changes to my website, I had messed up the package.json file and couldn&#x27;t get yarn to execute its handy scripts for the life of me.</p><p>  It then led me to a rabbit-hole of frustration and deletions where I ended up losing my entire project locally (I wish I knew how I messed up <strong>that</strong> bad!!). But, mishaps happen! The only saving light happened to be a random branch I had accidentally made on GitHub when I still had all the files in tact.</p><p>   <img src="./ugh.gif" alt="kao8"/></p><p>  Now, with that experience, I am a huge propagator of keeping track of almost all changes you make to your site using git (or your favorite version control system). Trust me, it is going to be a literal sanity saver.</p></details><details><summary><h3>4. Using as few frameworks as possible</h3></summary><p>   <img src="./014.gif" alt="kao9"/></p><p>  I basically run this entire website using Docusaurus which helps me manage <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react">React, Markdown</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/">Node</a>. Docusaurus also has its own CSS styling tool called <a href="https://infima.dev/">Infima</a> that standardizes all the themes on here, making things look simple and consistent! Of course, React makes my site very scalable (to the point that you can size down your browser to extremes and still not have most components act up and look horrible).</p><p>  In summary, pick a great framework that has all the needs of your website handled, all in one place, while also giving you the ability to completely take control over every component if needed.</p><p>   <img src="./020.gif" alt="kao11"/></p><p>  I have made a significant amount of additions and changes to the basic <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/playground">Docusaurus</a> features by learning the specifics of the technologies it builds on!</p><p>  You will know you have picked a great framework if it lets you break it apart and take control over all the tools it uses, while also exposing you to these new tools, helping you learn!</p></details><details><summary><h3>5. Hosting the site</h3></summary><p>  It&#x27;s not as fun if your website stays forever in localhost, never branching out into the world wide web! Again, an overwhelming number of site hosting solutions ranging from GoDaddy, WordPress and even some GUI based website builders such as Wix and Squaresite are out there for use.</p><p>  I am assuming, since you are reading this, you are tech savvy enough to not settle for pure GUI drag and drop website builders though (which is the best way to go in my personal opinion).  </p><p>  <img src="./computer05.gif" alt="kao13"/></p><p>  Just by learning a little bit of the basics of web hosting (and cloud services), you can host a pretty heavy-weight website for FREE on the interwebs. My webpage, as the name suggests, uses GitHub. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages">GitHub pages</a> is very highly documented and has an active community (similar to Docusaurus). It makes it super simple for me to push changes for the world to see with a few simple command line inputs locally.</p><p>  Again, the initial research and getting used to will be very tedious, but once you do find the right hosting service, you will know you found THE ONE when it boils down to being super simple in the long run. Plus, I get a cool domain name without spending a single cent!</p><p>  I have seen other commercial hosting services purposefully give their users really ugly, long and gross default domain names to incentivize them to spend money for better ones.</p><p>  <img src="./018.gif" alt="kao12"/></p><p>  That would not be the case if you were to choose a cloud hosting service such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/solutions/website-hosting/">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/hosting-your-website-on-github">GitHub pages</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting">Google Cloud</a> etc. (which do require you to know coding).</p></details><details><summary><h3>6. Making the site visually appealing</h3></summary><p>  Some go-to&#x27;s to have on your site:</p><ul><li><p>Scalable graphics</p></li><li><p>Collapsible sections</p></li><li><p>Minimal text blobs</p></li><li><p>Spacious layout</p><p><img src="./tiny.gif" alt="kao007"/></p><p>This area is more subjective than not and does depend on your preferences. However, if you want to tune your site towards a general range of audience, the simpler and easier to use your website is, the better!</p></li></ul></details><details><summary><h3>7. Browser console debugging</h3></summary><p>  In browser console&#x27;s have really upped their game. Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> have an almost IDE like console!</p><blockquote><p>✨ Brave: I recently found out about. It is super cool and gives creators cryptocurrency. I will make another post all about crypto, next!</p></blockquote><p>  For now, I wanted to mention about the tool named: &quot;Lighthouse&quot;. This is a website auditing tool which conveniently fetches you a report on your site&#x27;s performance and compliance with web and security standards.</p><p>  If anything, I would highly suggest any web dev out there to run their sites through Lighthouse at least once before deployment and take a note of the report!</p><p>  <img src="./barre14.gif" alt="kao003"/></p><p>  Here&#x27;s a quick look at a report that was generated for this site (<del>no bragging intended</del>):</p><p>  <img src="./lighthouse.png" alt="lighthouse"/></p><p>  If you expand the report, Lighthouse lays out all the details on what could be improved on your page, along with links to resources on building accessible, fast and reliable webpages! It is a great tool to truly delve deep into the world of web development.</p><p>  <img src="./fuu.gif" alt="kao005"/></p></details><p>I will leave it at these brief 7 ideas. Implementing them have personally helped me a lot in learning web development. Hopefully, these basic approaches can help you make a great website! And, good luck on centering that div!</p><p><img src="./barre18.gif" alt="kao002"/></p></details></details></article>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<details><summary> So you have to register for classes at 7:00am... </summary><h2>Let python do it for you with Selenium</h2><p><a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html"><img src="./logo.svg" alt="click me"/></a></p><p>Selenium is a web scraping tool that beautifully integrates with python. It allows you to automate webpage interactions.</p><p>I stumbled across it a while ago, but I had not used the actual API until recently. Long story short, I had to make a doctor&#x27;s appointment right at 12am to even find a spot (thank you American healthcare system!).</p><p>Regardless, whether it be to automate time sensitive actions or long and arduous form filling, Selenium is here for your rescue. I will go over a few useful Selenium methods that should equip you with basic webpage interactions.</p><blockquote><p>Note: these methods work as of November 2021</p></blockquote><h3>Useful Selenium methods</h3><hr/><p><code>service.start()</code></p><p>This <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Service.html">method</a> allows to set up a browser driver.</p><p>I personally used the chrome driver:</p><pre><code class="language-python">from selenium import webdriver

from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

service = Service(&#x27;/path/to/chromedriver&#x27;)

service.start()
</code></pre><blockquote><p>You will have to locally install the &#x27;chromedriver&#x27; executable. You can install it and find more usage examples <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started">here</a>.</p></blockquote><hr/><p><code>driver.get(url)</code></p><p>Once you have the browser all set up, you can connect to it remotely with Selenium using the .get method as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-python">driver = webdriver.Remote(service.service_url)
driver.get(&#x27;[insert url of page you want to selenium to work its magic on]&#x27;)
</code></pre><p>And, that&#x27;s the basic set up! You can now inspect element on the target webpage to figure out which fields you want to automate interaction with.</p><hr/><p><code>driver.find_element</code></p><p>Let&#x27;s say, I want to automatically search something on Google. I would first figure out the class name/ID of the search bar using &quot;inspect element&quot;:</p><p><img src="./snip.png" alt="google"/></p><p>Since there is only a class name of <code>gLFyf</code> attached, it would be used to select the search bar and insert a value to search using the code:</p><pre><code class="language-python">searchbar = &#x27;gLFyf&#x27;
driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,searchbar).send_keys(&quot;[value to search]&quot;)
</code></pre><blockquote><p>The send_keys method can take an array as well to fit the format of the input field. Regardless of the type of input, &quot; &quot; are needed.</p></blockquote><hr/><p><code>actions</code></p><p>Finally, you can make Selenium click the search button by repeating a similar process of finding the search button&#x27;s class name/ID. Here&#x27;s a sample snippet:</p><pre><code class="language-python">submit = &quot;gNO89b&quot;
driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, submit).click()
</code></pre><blockquote><p>A full list of different actions Selenium can perform can be found <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/navigating.html">here</a>.</p></blockquote><hr/><p><code>driver.quit()</code></p><p>Don&#x27;t forget to close the automation process and the browser by using the quit method at the end!</p><hr/><h4>Have fun with your newfound web super power.</h4><blockquote><p>Tip: you can also schedule your python script to execute during specific times using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/cron#Crontab_format">cron</a></p></blockquote></details>]]></content>
